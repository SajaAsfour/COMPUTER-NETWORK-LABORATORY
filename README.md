# 🌐 Computer Network Laboratory Reports

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **experiment reports, prelabs, and Packet Tracer (.pkt) circuits** for the **Computer Network Laboratory** course at **Birzeit University**. The reports focus on **network configurations, routing protocols, and practical simulations** using tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

## 🛠 Topics Covered
- ✅ **Basic Network Configurations (IP Addressing, Subnetting)**
- ✅ **Routing Protocols (Static, RIP, OSPF, EIGRP)**
- ✅ **VLANs & Inter-VLAN Routing**
- ✅ **Network Address Translation (NAT) & Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
- ✅ **DHCP & DNS Configurations**
- ✅ **Wireless Network Simulations**

## 📂 Contents
- 📜 **Prelabs:** Theoretical background, network design, and expected results.
- 📝 **Lab Reports:** Practical experiments, network analysis, and observations.
- 💾 **Packet Tracer (.pkt) Files:** Simulations of network topologies.

## 📌 Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulations
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts & protocols
